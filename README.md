A simple calculator made by me, Water_Gazes#9999. Created with the library PyQT5 and written in Python. This is my first publicly avaliable project that I have ever made and my first time using GitHub. I apologize if I have done something incorrectly or break something in the future.


Requirements: 
```
Python 3.9.6 (Note: This version of Python is not required to run the code but it is the only version I have tested it on. Use earlier or later versions at your own discretion.)
PyQT5 Version 5.15.6 (Note: This version is not required but it is the only version I have tested my application on. Use earlier or later versions at your own discretion.)
```

You can install PyQT5 by running the following code in to windows command prompt: `pip install PyQT5`

To run the application you first need to verify that `Simple_Calculator.py` is in the same directory as `Simple Calculator Icon.png`. You would then need to execute the file by writing the following code in to windows command prompt:
```
cd <The directory Simple_Calculator.py was installed in>
python Simple_Calculator.py
```

To convert this application in to a standalone executable file you can use an application called `auto-py-to-exe`. You can install it by running `pip install auto-py-to-exe`. Ater the module has installed, type in the following: `auto-py-to-exe`. This will open an application which you will need to configure with the following settings:

Click `CONVERT .PY TO .EXE` and open the output folder. This should give you a standalone executable file which you can use like any other app on your desktop.

If you have any issues, as always create a ticket and I will get back to you as soon as possible!
